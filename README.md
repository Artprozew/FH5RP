# FH5RP
Discord Rich Presence for Forza Horizon 5

## Getting started

### Step 1:
Download [latest release](https://github.com/jaiden-d/FH5RP/releases)

### Step 2:
Extract all contents of release zip to new folder

### Step 3:
Run FH5RP.exe

### Step 4:
Setup FH5's data out settings to point to the FH5RP listen server:
![Data out settings](/wwwroot/img/dataoutsettings.png?raw=true)

### Step 5 (optional):
Open up the webapp in your browser of choice. The default app URLs are displayed on startup in the console window.
Default: http://localhost:5000

## Building
FH5RP is built using .NET 6.0 and ASP.NET Core. Download the required .NET 6 SDK or install via Visual Studio 2022 to be able to build the project.

## Contributing
FH5RP is haphazardly developed on little-to-no knowledge of ASP.NET (but is based on my FH4RP project), so the codebase is easily defined as unoptimized - especially when it comes to SignalR and Blazor/Razor. I welcome all contributions in the form of pull requests from those who wish to help me on this endeavour.
